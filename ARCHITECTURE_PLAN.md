# Architecture Modernization Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for modernizing the application architecture, with each phase on its own branch.

## Branch Strategy

Each architectural phase will be implemented in its own dedicated branch:

1. **Phase 1: Data Layer Abstraction** - `architecture/phase1-data-layer`
   - Repository pattern implementation
   - Firebase adapters
   - IndexedDB integration
   - Dependency injection for data access

2. **Phase 2: State Management** - `architecture/phase2-state-management`
   - Centralized state container
   - Pub/sub event system
   - UI state normalization
   - Action-based updates

3. **Phase 3: Component Framework** - `architecture/phase3-component-framework`
   - Lightweight component framework adoption
   - Component hierarchy definition
   - Templating system
   - Props/attributes API

4. **Phase 4: CSS Architecture** - `architecture/phase4-css-architecture`
   - Design token system
   - BEM methodology implementation
   - Responsive utility classes
   - Theme system improvements

5. **Phase 5: Testing Implementation** - `architecture/phase5-testing`
   - Jest configuration
   - Component testing framework
   - Repository mocks
   - Integration test suite

## Implementation Order

The phases should be implemented in the following order:

1. Data Layer Abstraction (Phase 1)
2. State Management (Phase 2)
3. CSS Architecture (Phase 4)
4. Component Framework (Phase 3)
5. Testing Implementation (Phase 5)

This order provides the most incremental value while minimizing disruption.

## Merge Strategy

After each phase is complete and tested:

1. Open a Pull Request from the phase branch to the main branch
2. Review the changes for consistency and performance
3. Run the application to ensure no regressions
4. Merge the branch using a squash or rebase strategy to maintain clean history

## Status

- Phase 1: Implemented on branch `architecture/phase1-data-layer`
- Phase 2: Not started
- Phase 3: Not started
- Phase 4: Not started
- Phase 5: Not started
